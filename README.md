In less than 60 years, the European Dream went from "let's stop massacring each other" to "we could make more business if the size of the sausage slices were standardized".

In that journey, a Nobel price was won and a EU-bubble has been created around the European Institutions. Within that space and isolated from the rest of Europe, they have developed their own language, full of expressions like "advocate, synergies, assessments, exploring the idea of benchmarking...".

A normal citizen confronted with that snow job is tempted to disregard them as buckets of weasel words. It couldn't be further from the truth! It's simply because the European Institutions have lost their ability to listen to citizen that they have developed a communication form that very few understand, but be sure there is a hidden meaning under the layers of PR gimmicks and puffery.

I've teamed up with the best antropologist, code cipher specialists and linguists experts. They have studied for months the few that escaped the bubble to develop an EU jargon dictionary. With that knowledge, I've been told they can almost read a complete memo on "citizen engagement 2030" without falling asleep.

To make it finally understandable the pages from the European Commission to you too, install this chrome extension, it automatically translates the most commonly used idiomatic expressions into something you will understand.

- Launch an EU-wide public consultation -> Stall
- Assess the need for improvements -> Ignore
- Explore the idea of benchmarking -> Ignore
- Promote structured dialogue between stakeholders -> Meeting with coffee
- Step up efforts towards -> Meeting with sandwiches
- Invite Member States to take account -> being ignored by the Council
- Stimulate innovative approaches -> handjob anyone?
- Further developing streamlined -> Build a labyrinth

Future
------
Some spin has been missed. Be part of our team and tweet with the hashtag #eucipher and we'll try to add them. Beware that EU language is a rather verbose one, it might not fit under the 140 max char limit.

Limitations
------
It doesn't work on pdf or powerpoint. I know, it's a big limitation given the love the institutions have with these formats, especially given they aren't using any of the layout features that would thought could almost justify using them.

If you have to read these, I feel your pain. If it helps, think you could have had to see them presented. If it still doesn't, think you will be forced to drink the coffee they serve.

zip -r ../EUCifer.xpi *

This site criticises the European institutions to snow job and abuse weasel words. And if you find that using handjob is the most offensive issue on this page, you might want to think more about what democracy means.
